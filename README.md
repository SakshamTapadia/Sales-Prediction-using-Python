# Sales Prediction using Python

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a model to predict sales trends and patterns using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various features that can influence sales, and the goal is to build a predictive model to forecast future sales.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task4%20-%20DataSet.csv). It contains the following columns:

- **Date**: Date of the sales record
- **Store**: Store ID
- **Item**: Item ID
- **Sales**: Number of items sold

## Project Notebook

The complete project notebook is available [here](https://github.com/SakshamTapadia/CODSOFT/blob/main/Task4%20-Sales%20Prediction%20using%20Python.ipynb). It includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:
    - Load and inspect the dataset.
    - Handle missing values.
    - Convert date column to datetime format.
    - Feature engineering to extract additional features from the date column (e.g., month, day, year).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Visualize sales trends over time.
    - Analyze the distribution of sales across different stores and items.
    - Identify any seasonality or patterns in the sales data.

3. **Model Building**:
    - Split the data into training and testing sets.
    - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).
    - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**:
    - Compare the performance of different models.
    - Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

5. **Prediction and Conclusion**:
    - Make predictions on the test set.
    - Summarize the findings and conclusion.

## Results

The results of the model evaluation and the final predictions on the test set are included in the project notebook. The best performing model achieved high accuracy and provided insights into the most important features influencing sales predictions.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict sales trends and patterns. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation, we can build accurate predictive models and gain valuable insights into sales forecasting.
